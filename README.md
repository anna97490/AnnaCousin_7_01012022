## This is the last project of my course as web developer with Openclassrooms.

## Subject : Create a corporate social network 
```
An MVP/ A minimum viable project is thus required
```

## Constraints/Limitations:
```
The presentation of the features should be simple.
The creation of an account should be easy and possible from a mobile phone.
The profile should be limited in information so that it can be completed rapidly.
The suppression of the account should be possible.
The employees should be able to have access to a forum to publish text.
The users should be able to easily locate the latest employee contributions.
The community manager/ communication manager must be able to moderate interactions between employees.
The use of MySQL and VueJS is required.

NB : This is my first project implying the use of these technologies.
